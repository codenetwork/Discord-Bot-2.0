# Cogs

Functionality of the Code Network bot is organised into cogs, discord.py's way of separating concerns within the codebase. Information about cogs can be found here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html.

## Naming convention

The file name and cog name should be suffixed with "cog", so for example if my cog was concerned with authentication, the file name and cog name should be

- `auth_cog.py`
- `AuthCog`
